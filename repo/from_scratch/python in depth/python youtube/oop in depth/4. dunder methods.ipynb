    "\n",
    "2. Implement the __str__() method in the Employee class. It should return a formatted string that represents the employee's name and ID.\n",

    "3. Define the __eq__() method in the Employee class. This method compares the employee's employee_id with another object of the same class. If they match, return True; otherwise, return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. create a derived class Manager that inherits from the Employee class. Add an additional attribute, department, in the __init__() method of the Manager class. Use super() to call the base class's __init__() method and pass the required arguments.\n",

    "5. Implement the __str__() method in the Manager class to return a formatted string that includes the manager's name, ID, and department.\n",

    "6. Define the __eq__() method in the Manager class. Similar to the Employee class, compare the manager's employee_id with another object of the same class.\n",

    "\n",
    "10. Finally, in the Employee, Manager, and Staff classes, implement the __add__() method. For the Employee class, simply return an error message as adding two employees is not meaningful. In the Manager class, check if the other object is also a Manager and if their departments match. If the conditions are met, create a new Manager object with the combined names, a unique ID of -1, and the shared department. Otherwise, return an error message stating that addition cannot be performed between managers from different departments. For the Staff class, return an error message as adding staff members is not allowed.\n",

    "1. The code begins with the definition of the `Item` class. It has two main methods:\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method initializes an `Item` object with a `title` and an `author`.\n",

    "2. The `Book` class is defined, which inherits from the `Item` class. It introduces additional functionality:\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method initializes a `Book` object with a `title`, `author`, and the number of `pages`.\n",
    "   - The `__len__` method returns the number of pages in the `Book` object when the `len()` function is applied to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `DVD` class is defined, also inheriting from the `Item` class. It includes its own unique features:\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method initializes a `DVD` object with a `title`, `director`, and `duration` in minutes.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. The `LibraryItem` class is defined, which inherits from both `Book` and `DVD` classes. It combines their attributes:\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method initializes a `LibraryItem` object with a `title`, `author`, `pages`, `director`, `duration`, and `copies`.\n",
    "   - It calls the `__init__` methods of both `Book` and `DVD` classes to initialize their respective attributes.\n",
    "   - The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the `LibraryItem` object, including information about the book's pages and the DVD's duration.\n",
    "   - The `__add__` method allows adding two `LibraryItem` instances together if they have the same title. It combines their copy counts and returns a new `LibraryItem` object with the updated copy count.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the usage example:\n",
    "   - An instance of the `Book` class named `book` is created with the title \"Python Crash Course\", the author \"Eric Matthes\", and 544 pages.\n",
    "   - An instance of the `DVD` class named `dvd` is created with the title \"Inception\", the director \"Christopher Nolan\", and a duration of 148 minutes.\n",
    "   - An instance of the `LibraryItem` class named `library_item` is created, representing a combination of the book and DVD. It has the title \"Python Crash Course\", the author \"Eric Matthes\", 544 pages, the director \"Christopher Nolan\", a duration of 148 minutes, and 5 copies.\n",
    "   - The code demonstrates the usage of various methods:\n",
    "     - Printing the string representation of `book`, which outputs \"Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes\".\n",
    "     - Printing the string representation of `dvd`, which outputs \"Inception by Christopher Nolan\".\n",
    "     - Printing the string representation of `library_item`, which outputs \"Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes (Book: 544 pages, DVD: 148 minutes)\".\n",

    "     - Adding `library_item` to itself and assigning the result to `combined_item`.\n",
    "     - Printing the string representation of `combined_item`, which shows the combined copy count.\n",

    "Cryptocurrency management system. It defines classes such as `Crypto`, `Bitcoin`, and `Ethereum` to represent cryptocurrencies, their properties, and operations. The code allows users to create cryptocurrency objects, compare them, combine them, set prices, retrieve prices, and calculate the total value of cryptocurrency holdings. It also showcases specialized methods for Bitcoin mining and Ethereum token minting.\n",

    "1. The code introduces the `Crypto` class, which serves as a foundation for creating and manipulating various cryptocurrencies. It includes several essential methods:\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method initializes a `Crypto` object with a given `name`.\n",
    "   - The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the `Crypto` object, describing it as a cryptocurrency.\n",
    "   - The `__eq__` method enables comparison between two `Crypto` objects based on their names.\n",
    "   - The `__add__` method allows the merging of two `Crypto` objects, combining their names into a new cryptocurrency.\n",
    "   - The `set_price` method assigns a price to the `Crypto` object.\n",
    "   - The `get_price` method retrieves the assigned price of the `Crypto` object, if set.\n",
    "   - The `calculate_total_value` method calculates the total value of a given quantity of the `Crypto` object, based on its assigned price.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two subclasses of `Crypto` are defined:\n",
    "   - The `Bitcoin` subclass represents the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It inherits from `Crypto` and includes a `mine` method that simulates the mining process.\n",
    "   - The `Ethereum` subclass represents the Ethereum cryptocurrency. It also inherits from `Crypto` and includes a `mint` method that simulates the creation of Ethereum tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the usage example:\n",
    "   - Instances of the `Crypto`, `Bitcoin`, and `Ethereum` classes are created, each with their respective names.\n",
    "   - Various methods of the classes are demonstrated:\n",
    "     - Printing the string representation of a `Crypto` object.\n",
    "     - Comparing two `Crypto` objects for equality.\n",
    "     - Combining the names of two `Crypto` objects into a new cryptocurrency.\n",
