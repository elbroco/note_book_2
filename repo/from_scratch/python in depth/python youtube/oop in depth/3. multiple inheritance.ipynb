    "In a world where transportation is evolving, there exists a class called \"Vehicle\" that represents a generic vehicle with attributes such as make, model, and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####\n",
    "\n",
    "In parallel, there are two specialized classes, namely \"ElectricVehicle\" and \"GasolineVehicle.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"ElectricVehicle\" class focuses on vehicles powered by electricity and includes features like battery capacity and the ability to charge. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"GasolineVehicle\" class, on the other hand, deals with vehicles powered by gasoline and includes attributes like fuel capacity and the ability to refuel. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Both of these classes also have a method called \"get_range\" which calculates the range of the vehicle based on their respective energy sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine a futuristic hybrid car called \"HybridCar\" that combines the features of an electric vehicle and a gasoline vehicle. \n",
    "\n",
    "-This class inherits from the \"Vehicle,\" \"ElectricVehicle,\" and \"GasolineVehicle\" classes. By leveraging multiple class inheritance, the \"HybridCar\" class brings together the capabilities of both electric and gasoline-powered vehicles into a single entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#####\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside your classes, we create an object of the \"HybridCar\" class, specifically a Toyota Prius model from 2022. The car is equipped with a battery capacity of 5.5 kWh and a fuel capacity of 40 gallons. The \"HybridCar\" class utilizes the initialization methods of its parent classes to set up the vehicle attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase the car's functionality, we call the \"charge\" method to obtain the battery capacity, the \"refuel\" method to get the fuel capacity, and the \"get_range\" method to calculate the battery and fuel range. \n",
    "\n",
    "The range is calculated by assuming that 1 unit of battery capacity provides 5 miles of range, and 1 unit of fuel capacity offers 20 miles of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we print out the obtained values of battery capacity, fuel capacity, battery range, and fuel range to display the capabilities of the hybrid car.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code shows the concept of multiple class inheritance in the context of a hybrid car, showcasing the integration of electric and gasoline vehicle features into a single vehicle model"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a Bank that offered various types of accounts to its customers. One of the account types was called \"Savings Account.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "A Savings Account was a special type of account that allowed customers to save their money and earn interest on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent this Savings Account in code, the bank created a class called \"SavingsAccount.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "-This class inherited from two other classes: \"InterestBearingAccount\" and \"TransactionHistory.\" Let's dive into each class and see what they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "###\n",
    "\n",
    "The first class, \"Account,\" served as the foundation for all types of bank accounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "-It had essential attributes like the account number and the balance. \n",
    "\n",
    "-It also had methods for depositing and withdrawing money from the account. These methods would update the account's balance accordingly.  Both accepting an amount and adding that to the balance property\n",
    "\n",
    "##\n",
    "\n",
    "The second class, \"InterestBearingAccount,\" was a specialized type of account that earned interest on the balance. \n",
    "\n",
    "-In addition to the attributes and methods inherited from the \"Account\" class, it had an extra attribute called interest_rate \n",
    "\n",
    "-This attribute represented the interest rate at which the account earned interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "-The class also had a method called \"calculate_interest\" that calculated the interest earned based on the balance and the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "##\n",
    "\n",
    "The third class, \"TransactionHistory,\" was responsible for keeping track of all the transactions made on an account. \n",
    "\n",
    "-It had a list to store the transaction history, and methods to add transactions and display them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's go back to the \"SavingsAccount\" class. It inherited from both \"InterestBearingAccount\" and \"TransactionHistory,\" combining their functionalities into a single class. \n",
    "\n",
    "-It had an additional initialization method that called the initialization methods of its parent classes to set up the necessary attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#####\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside the classes, a new Savings Account was created with an account number \"SA123,\" an initial balance of $1000, and an interest rate of 0.05 (5%). The account was then used to deposit $500 and withdraw $200. The interest earned on the account and the current balance were calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of the transactions, two transaction records were added to the account's transaction history using the \"add_transaction\" method. Finally, the transaction history was displayed, showing the deposit and withdrawal transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the story, the account balance and the interest earned were printed to give the customer an overview of their savings account.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a basic structure for managing a savings account, calculating interest, and maintaining a transaction history. It can be used as a starting point for building more sophisticated banking systems or as a learning resource for understanding inheritance and class relationships in Python."

    "-It introduces 4 methods!\n",
    "\n",
    "-A cart to store products list, manage the cart, such as adding products, removing products, and viewing the cart methods \n",

    "Seller Class:\n",
    "The `Seller` class also inherits from the `User` class and provides functionality specific to sellers. \n",

    "Outside your classes, a customer and a seller are instantiated as objects of their respective classes. Two products, a shirt and shoes, are also created as instances of the `Product` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer adds the products to their cart using the `add_to_cart()` method and views the contents of the cart using the `view_cart()` method. The customer then saves the cart to a file using the `save_cart_to_file()` method. One of the products is removed from the cart using the `remove_from_cart()` method, and the cart is viewed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seller adds the products to their list of products using the `add_product()` method and views the available products using the `view_products()` method. The seller then saves the list of products to a file using the `save_products_to_file()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code simulates a basic online shopping system, allowing customers to add products to their cart and sellers to manage their list of products for sale. It demonstrates the use of class inheritance and file handling to facilitate interactions between customers, sellers, and products in an e-commerce environment."
