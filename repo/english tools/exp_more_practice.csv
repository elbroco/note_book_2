Good timing,(the ability to do something at exactly the right time)
If you´re man enough to face me
I´m saving you for last
Thank goodness
Leave some ladies for the rest of us
Keep your head out of the clouds and your priority straight
Tell us all about your magical romance
Listen to you two
The best way to win a girl´s heart is...
How long were you standing there
Come right in
You had a good run
What´s the big idea?
He fooled us all
This is very disturbing news
There might not be any relationship to worry about later
I could use some extra help
This is in your hands now
I made it very clear , I don´t know how to drive
Everything is terrific
You´re a real straight shooter
This is as far as we go
We must set things right
Did I drop the conversation
Deep into the forest
In the process we destroyed it
No wonder why you guys don´t like each other
I´ll keep an eye on her for you
You never seize to amaze me
(I´m) sill not clear on that
That´s gets me all worked up
You´re gonna hurt yourself
You´re done with the lecture mom?
I´m not in the hunt for you
The coast is clear
For crying out loud
If you do this there is no going back
I´m facing this as any other citizen
I think we should probably head back
Why do I get the feeling he´s right?
It happens
That was the last time they ever spoke
It´s been done as we speak
No one has seen them since
Let’s get you out of here
You´re the best cousin a guy could ever have
What was your name again?
I think I could use a break
Can you interpret that?
This time like you mean it
It´s a high-level move with something extra thrown in
For a second there, I thought you were a ghost
We had them right under our noses
Would you stop ignoring me and tell me what´s going on?
It was for your own good/safety
You shouldn´t be walking here all alone
Right this way
You´ve done your research
This is too juicy
I can´t stay mad at you
I don´t need to explain myself to you
Don´t put it on me
My chef will blow the tastes buds right out your mouth
We’re in the same boat
A student is only as good as his master
